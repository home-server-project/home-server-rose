## Universal Blue uCore

The Realtek USB Ethernet udev rule in
`system_files/etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb-realtek-net.rules` is adapted from the Universal Blue uCore
project:

https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore

uCore is distributed under Apache-2.0. The rule has been carried over because it is useful generic
home-server hardware enablement; comments were adjusted for this project.

## UPSide

Built in an isolated builder stage. Build dependencies do not remain in the final image.

## Superfile

https://github.com/yorukot/superfile

Built in an isolated builder stage. The upstream license is copied into the image.

## VirtUI Manager

https://github.com/aginies/virtui-manager

Home Server Rose HCI packages VirtUI Manager locally while preserving its upstream GPL-3.0-or-later
license. Its private Python dependency directory avoids replacing AlmaLinux system Python packages.

## mergerfs

https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs

The image follows the latest stable upstream EL10 RPM by default and verifies the upstream-published
SHA-256 digest. A version pin is used only as a temporary regression workaround.
